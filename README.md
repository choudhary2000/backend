## Following thing I consider in the assignment

1. Result always declared at fixed time. for example(8:00 pm)
2. An event has fixed number of tickets and winners
3. All user already present in the databases
4. In tickets I'm using Alphanumeric charaset [a-z A-Z 0-9]

## About assignment

1. I used node and express for server
2. Knex for database migration and query building
3. PostresSQL as database
4. Node-cron for cron job
5. async-retry for retry
6. joi for validation
7. With the help of **Randomstring** package generating packages



### How I created raffle tickets for an event

1. Lets us assume L be the limits of an event(i.e. that many ticket will be sells for an event)
2. Therefore minimum characters in a ticket should be **C=** **ceil(log(L)/log(62))** (here 62 be the charaset)
3. Then, I will generate L different tickets of length(**C**) using randomstring package

Above implementation can be found in: ***src/helper/generateticketsforevent.js***



### How I calculated winners of an event

â€‹	***Assuming result always declared at 8:00pm(can be change from environment variable***

1. I created an cron job that run every day at scheduled time
2. Then, It fetch all events whose **event_date(timestamp) <= current date+time** and **status- NOT_DECLARED**
3. Then, for a given event, using event_id, fetching all participants from participations table
4. Then generating desire amount of winners by randomly sorting all participants
5. Then insert winners for the event into winners table and update **event.Status to DECLARED**

 	6. If any of events winners calculation get failed then, It will retry again upto 5 times
 	7. After 5 times, calculation still failing then here we can implement wake up call mechanism(such as email triggers or slack messaging)
